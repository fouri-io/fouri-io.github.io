**<i>Currently</i>**

Colby Ward is a Software Development Manager at Amazon, currently owning the Customer Experience for Amazon Exports. Amazon International Shopping mode ([AIS](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=20338496011)) is his latest endeavor, growing far beyond its [humble origins](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/amazon-finally-made-its-e-commerce-service-usable-for-international-customers/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFYAiTUobAglaXpaEGOIgNl8S9tKqXQjtLoXxOi1BdzEZKXMm_tZZ8rwyot7OEmexZmQYx0CejivCuTWG6y3XeR_azUWlu-2rToO6YAa7bIMHYZ2-Lldf_Cm3MhlfPoOFj9Q6RinQ24sb8uCXDCBh9ZjizkvotHCMTZVAnug2tom) to a global framework serving a personalized, localized, and unique experience for Amazon's cross-border customers across marketplaces. Colby joined Amazon as Search & Discovery lead for Amazon Expansions. He is most proud of building Search for [Amazon Australia](https://www.amazon.com.au/s?k=colby&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) and [Amazon Singapore](https://www.amazon.sg/s?k=colby&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) marketplace launches, prior to joining Exports.

Colby's passion is technology, with a talent for crafting architecture and software that solves a critical need or drives business growth. He enjoys writing about tech, occasionally speaking, and hopefully informing some, while adding witty commentary (or so he thinks) to keep things interesting.

**<i>Before that</i>**

He holds a B.S. in Computer Science from the Warrington College of Business -- University of Florida and began his career working for Microsoft as an engineer in the early 2000s.
